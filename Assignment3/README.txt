	the piece. The game board is printed after every move, where the game pieces are printed as formatted strings. The pawns are
	printed with a "P", the color, and the pawn number. ex. "PW3" means the third pawn on the white team. Knights are only printed
	with a "K" and the color. ex. "KB" is the Knight on the black team. The Dark Knight.
